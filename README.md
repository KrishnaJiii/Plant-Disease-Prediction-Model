📌 Project Overview

Plant diseases significantly affect agricultural productivity. Early and accurate detection of these diseases can help farmers take timely action.
This project uses Deep Learning and Computer Vision to classify plant leaf images into healthy or diseased categories.

The trained model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to upload a leaf image and instantly receive a disease prediction.
